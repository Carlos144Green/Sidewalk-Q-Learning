# Sidewalk-Q-Learning
In this repo the program uses Q-learning to get itself to the end of the sidewalk while picking up as much litter as possible. Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of an action in a particular state from exploring and exploiting. Thankfully it does not require a model of the environment and it can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards without requiring adaptations. For Reinforcement Learning, Q-learning is a fundamental block to understanding how computers can learn unsupervised. There are many methods of Reinforcement Learning but Q-learning is the most basic of them all.
